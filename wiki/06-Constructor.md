## Initialization: ***constructor()***

`constructor(param1, param2, ...)` is a special method in the body of a class that initializes the instance, 
it is called automatically when a class is initiated and it has to have the exact name **`constructor`**,

In the following example the constructor sets the initial value of the field `name`:

```js
class User {
  constructor(name) {    
    this.name = name;  
  }
}
```
**`User`**’s constructor has one parameter `name`, which is used to set the initial value of the field `this.name`. 

The arguments used to instantiate the class becomes the parameters of the constructor:
```js

class User {
  constructor(name) {
   // Here name will be "Jon Snow"
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const user = new User("Jon Snow");
console.log(user.name)
```
```
// Output
Jon Snow
```
`name` parameter inside the constructor has the value `"Jon Snow"`.

* ### Let's have another example
```js
class Country {
  constructor(name, yearFounded) {
    this.name = name
    this.yearFounded = yearFounded
  }
}

const america = new Country("The United States of America", 1776)

console.log(america.name);
console.log(america.yearFounded);
```
```
// Output
The United States of America
1776
```
**Note:** If you don’t define a constructor for the class, a **default** one is created. The default constructor is an empty function, which doesn’t modify the instance.
