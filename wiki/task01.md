## Task01
### Write a js program for number system
Create an object named **numberSystem** with three members.
* Members:
  * ```js
    numberData: {
        primeNumbers: // put a number here,
        fibonnaci: // put a number here
    }
    ```
  * sum_prime_number
  * fibonacci_Nth_term
* **sum_prime_number** function will calculate sum of all prime numbers before the above mentioned **primeNumbers** inside **numberData** member
* **fibonacci_Nth_term** function will calculated the **Nth** term of a fibonacci series, where **N** is the **fibonnaci** number inside **numberData** member
* *Caution*: For accessing members use `this` keyword.

Steps:
* You have to code inside **task01.js** file.
* Finally export your object using 
* ```js
  module.exports = numberSystem;
  ```
