## Task09
### Write a js program to create map_armstrong funciton.
Create a function with two parameters **pre_map** **arr**. Where **pre_map** will be an in-built map provided to you through our test cases and **arr** will be an array of numbers. For each element from the gievn array, your function should check whether that element exist in your given **pre_map** as it's **key** or not. If it exists then, `delete` it otherwise `add a new key` in that given **pre_map** where it's value will be a boolean value as either `true` of `false` based upon whether that key is an *`armstrong number`* or not.
* Export you function usiing `module.exports`.
