## Task04
### Write a js program for Square class
First of all, copy the code of **Shape** class you created earlier in the last task and paste it 
in your current task file *`task04.js`*. 
Now we'd like you to create a **Square** class that inherits from **Shape** class and adds a new `calcArea()`
 method that calculates and return the square's area. 
 Also set up the constructor so that the **name** property of **Square** object instances 
 is automatically set to `square`, 
 and the **sides** property is automatically set to `4`. 
 When invoking the constructor, you should therefore just need to provide the **sideLength** property.
```js
calcArea(){
  // make every function according to this structure
}
```
* Create an instance of the **Square** class by giving it a name **square** with a sideLength of 5
Steps:
* You have to code inside **task04.js** file.
* Calculate the **perimeter** and **area** of the **`square`** instance, as we need them to be exported later.
* Finally export your classes in given object format:

```js
  module.exports = {
      parentClass: Shape,
      childClass: Square, // The class name
      instance: square, // The instance name
      SquarePerimeter: //the variable with perimeter of square,
      SquareArea: // the variable with area of square
  }
  ```
