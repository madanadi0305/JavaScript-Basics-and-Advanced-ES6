### Write a js program to create map_sort function.
Create a function with one parameter as an array in the form `[[1,2,3,8,1,2], [54,26,14,54], [81,4,6,84]]`. You have to the remove all duplicate elements from the internal array of the given array `[1,2,3,8,1,2]`, `[54,26,14,54]` and `[81,4,6,84]` (*for example*). Then create a `map` by considering these new unique arrays as their `values` where the `keys` will be the **index value of these array** according to the given input parameter. Like `0` for `[1,2,3,8]`, `1` for `[54,26,14]` and `2` for `[81,4,6,84]`.
* Export your function using `module.exports`.
